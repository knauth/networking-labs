# Networking Labs

This is work I did for CS2505: Network Computing at University College Cork. These aren't meant to be maintainable or readable, just to implement the assignment. Lab 1 is about the basics of sockets and implements a simple client-server setup. Lab 2 is the most technically complex; we were asked to build a two-way chat program. I used PyQt to build a simple GUI for this. Lab 3 involved HTTP requests; here we built a client to send an HTTP request and display a server's response.
